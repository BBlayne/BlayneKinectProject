<h1>Codebase & Structure</h1>
<div id="Content" style="width: 600px;">
<p>
GLM (Opengl Math), ASSIMP (The Open Asset Importer Library) were the two
primary libraries used for this project.

Assimp has it's own internal representation for vectors, matrices, and orientations.
GLM's allow for easy matrix operations using the (*) operator that can be passed to
the appropriate shaders.

The application is designed according to suggestions from the olgdev tutorials 
(link in the project proposal document), which is structured around calling the
appropriate call backs.

Picking is handled through a hack where you give every mesh rendered in the scene a
unique colour that corresponds to an id that is associated with the corresponding bone.

The kinect's orientations are converted into local orientations through a matrix operations
by multiplying with the inverted parent transform of the selected mesh's bone.

There is some "masking" functionality implemented but not fully made use of where in theory
I could mask it so only the upper body used the kinect's orientations while allowing for manual
posing of the legs but I never got around to fully implementing this.

But for every bone that has a corresponding kinect bone, it's local orientation is overwritten
from the corresponding kinect joint orientation.

The Kinect handles tracking all bodies captured by the depth sensor, all my code does
is check the bodyframebuffer each frame and copies the relevent joint orientation data
each tick.
