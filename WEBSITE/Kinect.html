<div id="Explanation" style="width: 600px;">
<h3>Interpolation Mode</h3>
<p>
Four interpolation modes, these are dropdown menu's where simple left clicking 
selects the mode and enables it immediately if the correct
animation mode/animation is selected.
</p>
<br>
<h4>LERP</h4>
<p>
Linerally interpolates the rotation transformations by the formula:
</p>
<code>
x * ((Type)(1) - a) + (y * a)
</code>
<p>
Where x,y are Quaternions/Vectors and a is a floating point number representing the
time factor.

Each step is equidistant across the the entire interpolation.
</p>


<h4>SLERP</h4>
<p>
Spherical interpolation where the interpolation occurs along mapped quarter segments
of a circle (Not equidistant). 
</p>
<code>
	quat z = y;</br>

	float cosTheta = dot(x, y);</br>

	// If cosTheta < 0, the interpolation will take the long way around the sphere.</br>
	// To fix this, one quat must be negated.</br>
	if (cosTheta < (float)0)</br>
	{</br>
		z        = -y;</br>
		cosTheta = -cosTheta;</br>
	}</br>

	// Perform a linear interpolation when cosTheta is </br>
	//close to 1 to avoid side effect of sin(angle) becoming a zero denominator</br>
	if(cosTheta > (float)(1) - (float)epsilon())</br>
	{</br>
	// Linear interpolation</br>
		return quat(</br>
		mix(x.w, z.w, a),</br>
		mix(x.x, z.x, a),</br>
		mix(x.y, z.y, a),</br>
		mix(x.z, z.z, a));</br>
	}</br>
	else</br>
	{</br>
	// Essential Mathematics, page 467</br>
		float angle = acos(cosTheta);</br>
		return (sin(((float)(1) - a) * angle) * x + sin(a * angle) * z) / sin(angle);</br>
	}</br>
</code>
<p>
Where x,y are Quaternions/Vectors and a is a floating point number representing the
time factor.
</p>

<h4>Euler</h4>
<p>
Attempt to Linerally interpolates the rotation transformations by
converting the given quaternions to Euler angles, and then
interpolating them as vectors according to LERP.
</p>
<p>
This is likely to be problematic.
</p>

<h4>Matrix</h4>
<p>
Attempt to Linerally interpolates the rotation transformations by
converting the given quaternions to 4v4 Homogenous matrixes;
convert them back to Quaternions and then linearally interpolate.
</p>
<p>
It isn't clear to be how to interpolate from a matrix without converting
the matrix to some other orientation representation.

Internally in this application all rotations are quaternions and all
transformations are computed through matrix transformations.
</p>

<h3>Meshes</h3>
<p>
There are four selectable meshes given by "helpful" codenames.
George, Dave, Chebadiah, and "Bone".

All meshes are imported in both a "Basic" and "Skinned" configuration.
"Basic" meshes lack animations or bones or skinning.
While "Skinned" meshes have each vertex assignment with a vertex weight
to a up to four given bones that adds up to "1".

Skinned meshes should each with the exception of "Bone" have at least one animation.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>George represents a sort of "Doll-like" mesh.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Dave represents a low poly character.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Chebadiah is "Cheb" from the assignments with my own custom
		animations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>"Bone" was for testing UV mappings for a basic unit cube
		to test scale, basic transformations and so on,
		it is imported with "one" bone.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Animation Modes</h3>
<p>
There are 6 animation modes, each one enables a different way of viewing and 
interacting with the selected meshes.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<p>TPOSE just loads the basic mesh with default T-Pose.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Free uses the Kinect in real time but doesn't record anything.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>View allows frame by frame precision viewing of the selected animation
		for step by step progression through each frame of the animation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Insert/Kinect allows for the insertion of keyframes recorded from the Kinect.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Insert/Pose allows for the insertion of keyframes recorded from
		the user posing the mesh manually through direction
		bone manipulation.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p>Player allows to for animation playback from the currently selected
		animation.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>
Each of the provided meshes should have at least one default animation imported
from blender.

But a new blank animation can be created by selecting the "new Animation" option
from the drop down.
</p>
<h3>Camera</h3>
<img src="menu_circle_selection.png">
<p>
The scene camera has a position represented as a x,y,z component vector.
Merely selected the "+" button to the left of "Position".
Then select the component you wish to modifier, select the displayed number,
and then to best modify if, input a number and then click away, do not press enter.

Additionally there are +/- buttons to the right of the input field,
and a 'dot' that can be clicked, clicking on the dot brings up a white circle.

Holding down the left mouse button when this circle is displayed, and then dragging
the mouse around the edge of the white circle, and adjust the number to the left quickly.
</p>
<h3>ObjRotation</h3>
<p>
This allows to rotate the current mesh according to x,y,z in Euler angles.

Currently it does not rotate the mesh's skeleton if Insert/Pose mode is selected.
</p>

<h3>CamRotation</h3>
<p>
This allows to rotate the camera around the origin of the scene in
x,y,z euler angles ala an "orbit".
</p>
<h3>ObjPosition</h3>
<p>
This allows to translate the mesh through the scene according to
global x,y,z coordinates.
</p>
<h3>DirLight1</h3>
<p>
Depending on the current animation mode we can adjust the ambient lighting
of the scene, it's colour and intensity.

This was mainly for the shaders.
</p>
<h3>Insert Keyframe</h3>
<p>
Select the '+' button to the left of the input field for "Current Frame"
to select a "time" in seconds in the current animation to insert a new key frame.

This is tied to Set Duration; the max keyframe is equal to maximum duration value
set in Set Duration.
</p>

<h3>Set Duration</h3>
<p>
Animations usually have a certain total amount of time it takes to complete the animation;
and thus there can be a maximum number of keyframes equal to the animation time (as an int).

As duration is set to being larger the longer it should take for the animation to complete.
</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<p>
Select "George" for best results of Mesh.
Select "new Animation" (although this works for other animations to "overwrite" them).
Select "Insert/Kinect" is not already selected.
Make sure the Actor is standing clearly in the suggested space in front of the Kinect.
(Suggested meaning based on your own testing as to how far away and at what angle
best captures your movements using the Kinect Studio).
Set the new Duration of the animation to something appropriate, such as 30.
Select which frame under "Current Frame" to insert a new frame, remember each
increment corresponds to a "second" in animation time.
Click "Insert Keyframe".
</p>
<p>
To play back the animation after you've finished inserting new keyframes,
select "Player" under animation modes.

Or "View" and manually select which frame to observe under "Current Frame".
