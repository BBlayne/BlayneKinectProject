<h1>Issues</h1>
<div id="Content" style="width: 600px;">
<p>
Numerous issues were encountered throughout the course of the development
process for this project.<br>

Most of them were solved to varying degrees of success.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The Kinect basically should be used with two people as inserting
	key frames is difficult alone to operate the keyboard and pose
	at the same time, and is kinda tiring.
	</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The Bone orientation in blender appeared to affect the apparent orientation of
	the various bones (mainly the arms).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The Microsoft Kinect stores joint orientations in World Coordinates.
	Additionally they have their own bone roll orientation that differed
	from blender's causing difficulties. It isn't clear to me if this was
	reconciled.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Each library or online source used their own representation for either:
	Orientations/Quaternions/Matrices/Vectors, etc. Requiring significant testing
	to reconcile and convert them correctly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Euler & Matrix orientations I did not write appropriate notes for,
	so if they were properly with suggested theory behind them covered in class,
	I was not able to recreate the processes through searching online and
	did my best guess.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Conversion from my original code base to a "better" code base that was meant
	to be better organized and maintainable was fraught with issues and various
	transformations breaking unexpectedly.
	
	For example rotatin a bone with the camera rotated "worked" originally
	in my homework code, but in my project code where I used a different implementation
	it broke; right now if the camera is rotated around the origin, 
	I use a vector from the bone location to the camera position to
	determine a rotation axis; this has a slight tilt,
	it would work perfectly if I translated the camera to always be at the same
	"height"/relative position so from the bone's perspective
	the camera is directly orthogonal.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
